<p> Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a curious, innovative, and driven psychology student with in depth experience in social entrepreneurship, graphic design, and cross-disciplinary team leadership via design thinking methods. I'm looking to challenge assumptions, work with diverse people, and translate great ideas across industries and cultures.
My successful pursuits include creating a triple bottom line business in Ghana's rural developing economy, designing logos and mobile UX wireframes, and launching a music web site and creating multimedia content.
I am currently living in the Boston MA area, looking to meet and work alongside people who are using paradigm shifting methods to address challenges. If you have a story to share or want to know more about me, please get in touch with me below!<p>
