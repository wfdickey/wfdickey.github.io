<p> Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a curious, innovative, and <del>lazy</del> <ins>driven</ins> psychology student with in depth experience in social entrepreneurship, graphic design, and cross-disciplinary team leadership via design thinking methods.</p>
<p>I'm looking to challenge assumptions, work with diverse people, and translate great ideas across industries and cultures.
My successful pursuits include creating a triple bottom line business in Ghana's rural developing economy, designing logos and mobile UX wireframes, and launching <a href="https://www.relaux.com" target="_blank">a music web site</a> and creating multimedia content.</p>
<p> I am currently living in the Boston MA area, looking to meet and work alongside people who are using paradigm shifting methods to address challenges. If you have a story to share or want to know more about me, please get in touch with me below!</p>
