				<h2> One tab at a time: The zen of web Browsing </h2>
				<p>I have always had a few too many tabs open at any given time. By a few I mean like 30. This habit, like many others, was something that I never really noticed, not even when the titles of each individual tab became so slow, that my quest to find any past page was a guessing game.</p>
				<p>I eventually gave up even going back to past tabs because opening new tabs became an obsession. I would only feel a tiny bit of remorse when I clicked the red “x” and enter the ultimate battle against myself: “Are you sure you want to close 30 tabs?” The computer asked me first. I tended to avoid this altogether by never closing the window, while the window of opportunity slowly dwindled with my attention span.</p>
				<p>Opening new pages was like opium and I was addicted. The rush of a blank address bar, the flashing tease of a blinking cursor. I craved it all. I craved novelty. Something for my awareness to rip apart and spit out in a second, but only with the eyes. There was no heart. No compassion for the pages that I tossed into the pile, with a slim chance that I would ever grant them my full presence.</p>
				<p>My presence was far in the future, spending its energy on the expectation that the payoff was just around the corner, in the next meme, on his twitter feed. What I had found was never enough to appreciate.
				I persuaded myself that someday, I would get around to reading it or deleting it, but never before I had found that One Page.</p>
				<p>Not making a decision is a decision in itself. Essentially you are deciding not to decide. Begging passively for something or someone else to decide for you. Even the word “decide” rings connotations to “homocide”, to murder all of the other choices, a daunting task for someone who has a strong attachment to keeping all options open.</p>
				<p>If goals are of high value, making decisions to achieve those goals must be made with the intention of moving one step closer. Having one single tab open means all of your attention is focused on the present. If something is to be read later, make it accesible to yourself at a later time by making note of it in on a separate list. This will allow the habit of checking the list to arise naturally. As well as clearing the brain and the browser.</p>
				<p>So far I have been practicing this new habit, and like most new paths we tread, it does not come instantly. I am much more aware of where my attention is and how I am spending my time. I encourage you to try it yourself!</p>

				<p>7 | 10  | 13</p>
				<h2> Being okay with being an idiot</h2>
				<p>One of the most difficult things in life is starting a new project or a new hobby. Once we have that glimpse of creative insight, we believe it will take us to the finish line. And while maintaining the vision is crucial, it is easy to become discouraged by the process of having to start over.</p>

				<p>There are generally two types of learners: those who fail and give up, and those who fail over and over. Not surprisingly, those who fail over and over end up succeeding and living rich, diverse lifestyles, while those who give up create a narrower comfort zone for themselves. I have learned that the best way to succeed is to embrace failure. This takes a certain kind of mentality, more specifically it means loving being an idiot. An optimistic idiot.</p>

				<p>With our microwave culture, on-demand lifestyles, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain this “idiot” mentality. We expect to become instant experts from new technology. Our comparative and competitive nature leads us to believe that we don’t have time to mess around with the basics while the “others” get ahead. For example I have been trying to re-learn piano, and more specifically music theory. As a kid, I was very good at the piano, but I have lost touch with that skill. I often fall in the trap of believing that I don’t need to go back over the basics, that somehow with enough banging on the keyboard, I will create a masterpiece. And so far as I have taken that mentality, I have avoided failure and avoided the idiot mentality, essentially getting nowhere.</p>
				<p>So, I am challenging myself and any of my readers to take on that idiot mentality. To start something new and eliminate all expectations of grandeur. Instead, expect to fail. Then you might just surprise yourself with your success. The amount you learn can only be measured by your own scale of success.</p>
